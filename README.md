**ANY COURSEWORK OR PRIVATE FILES INCLUDED HERE ARE EXPIRED. I AM NOT SHARING ANY COURSEWORK FILES WHOSE DEADLINES ARE YET TO PASS.**
## Overview
This repository is used to annotate and list all my University work.

## Related Repositories
Keep in mind, not all courses warranted full GitHub repositories or did not allow for publishing of coursework at all, and as such I have no trace of them online.
